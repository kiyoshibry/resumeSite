# Resume Documentation by Ty Bryant

## Purpose
The goal of this README is to act as a guide for creating, formatting and hosting a resume as a static web site using _Pelican_.
This guided requires no prior knowledge with the working of Git or static site generators.

The goals we want to achieve are:

✅Write your own resume using **Markdown**

✅Generate a static website using **Pelican**

✅Use Git for version control

✅ Deploy the website using **GitHub Paghes**

This document also implements the best practices for technical documentation, outlined by _Andrew Etter_

## Prerequisites
Before you start creating your static site for your resume, you will need the following installed on your local machine:
1) **Python(3.6):** Install by going to [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads)
2) **Operating System**: Widnows 10 or 11, Linux, or macOS
3) **Pelican/Markdown**: Install both by typing on your command line/terminal
   ```
   pip install pelican markdown
   ```
